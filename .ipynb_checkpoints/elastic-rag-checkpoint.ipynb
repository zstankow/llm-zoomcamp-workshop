       "'If you\\'re encountering the error \"invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase\" when mapping volumes with Docker on Windows, the issue might be due to how the volume path is specified.\\n\\nHere are several approaches to resolve this:\\n\\n1. **Move Data to a No-Space Folder:**\\n   Ensure that your data is in a folder path without spaces. For instance, move your files from:\\n   ```\\n   C:/Users/Alexey Grigorev/git/...\\n   ```\\n   to:\\n   ```\\n   C:/git/...\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Volume Mapping Options:**\\n   Try replacing the `-v` part with one of the following:\\n   ```\\n   -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   -v //c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   -v /c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   -v //c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   --volume //driveletter/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Use `winpty`:**\\n   Prefix your command with `winpty`:\\n   ```\\n   winpty docker run -it \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_DB=\"ny_taxi\" \\\\\\n   -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\\\\\n   -p 5432:5432 \\\\\\n   postgres:1\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Using Quotes:**\\n   Add quotes around your volume paths:\\n   ```\\n   -v \"/c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   -v \"//c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   -v \"/c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   ```\\n\\nIf none of these options work, you might consider using a volume name instead of a path:\\n```\\n-v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n```\\n\\nTry these options and see if they solve the issue with the repository name format.'"
